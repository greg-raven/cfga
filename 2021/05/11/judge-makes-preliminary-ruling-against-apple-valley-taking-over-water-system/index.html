							A San Bernardino Superior Court judge has made a ruling against the Town of Apple Valley in its attempt to take over its largest supplier of water.
						</p>
						<span id="more-1171"></span> 
						<p>
							In a <a href="https://www.waterwedoing.website/docs/2021/20210507-tentative-decision.php">tentative decision</a> issued Friday, Judge Donald Alvarez found that Liberty Utilities had “disproved” the town&rsquo;s arguments that its acquisition of the company&rsquo;s water system would be in the public&rsquo;s interest and a necessity.
						</p>
						<p>
							Liberty also disproved that the “Town&rsquo;s project is planned in the manner that will be most compatible with the greatest public good &hellip; (and) the use for which the Town seeks to take Liberty&rsquo;s property is a more necessary public use than the use to which Liberty&rsquo;s property is presently devoted,” Alvarez wrote.
						</p>
						<p>
							Both Liberty and the Apple Valley have 15 days to serve and file objections to the decision before it is made final.
						</p>
						<p>
							“We are extremely disappointed in the court&rsquo;s tentative decision,” said Mayor Curt Emick. “We hope the judge considers the town&rsquo;s arguments and issues his final ruling to support the Town&rsquo;s effort to acquire the system.”
						</p>
						<p>
							Liberty did not respond immediately to a request for comment.
						</p>
						<p>
							The ruling comes after a lengthy effort by Apple Valley to acquire the water system that has been ongoing since 2011.
						</p>
						<p>
							The town filed its eminent domain lawsuit in January 2016 when the system was owned by Ranchos Water Company in response to what they said was a public outcry over rising water rates.
						</p>
						<p>
							Apple Valley residents passed Measure F in June 2017, which allowed the town to issue up to $150 million in revenue bond debt to acquire the system if were successful in the lawsuit.
						</p>
						<p>
							The “right-to-take” phase of the trail began with opening arguments in October 2019.
						</p>
						<p>
							Liberty attorneys argued that Apple Valley was “unprepared and unequipped” to operate the water system and that the takeover of the investor-owned utility was not in the public&rsquo;s interest.
						</p>
						<p>
							Attorneys for the town, meanwhile, said that local control by the town would lead to lower water rates and increased safety as related to the water infrastructure.
						</p>
						<p>
							The 67-day trial was suspended in March 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, resumed in June and testimony completed in July, Apple Valley officials said.
						</p>
						<p>
							“The trial included over 30 witnesses, including expert testimony from both sides, hundreds of exhibits and over 8,000 pages of trial transcripts,” according to a town statement.
						</p>
						<p>
							Closing arguments concluded in February.
						</p>
						<p>
							If Apple Valley officially loses the case and Alvarez&rsquo;s decision is made final, it would be responsible for both its own legal costs and Liberty&rsquo;s &mdash; neither have been disclosed publicly &mdash; which are estimated to be in the millions of dollars, the Daily Press reported.
						</p>
						<p>
							Town officials said Monday that if Alvarez&rsquo;s decision is made final, “the Town Council will consider its options, including appeal.”
