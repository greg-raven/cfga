						<p>
							While checking some of the Town of Apple Valley&rsquo;s claims about needing to increase taxes via Measure O, I came across some interesting information: The Town is already planning how to spend the additional money they hope to get from us.
						</p>
						<span id="more-1151"></span> 
						<p>
							For example, employee compensation will be going up 9.6% next year. That&rsquo;s almost a million dollars out of the 6-7 million they hope to get from raising our taxes. You know how they say they cut staff and cut salaries? Not so much, it appears.
						</p>
						<p>
							Other big gainers next year are Contract and Professional Services, with $900K more for the Engineering, $900K more for the Sheriff Department, $463K more for Apple Valley Choice Energy, $300K more for other Contract Services, $100K more for Innovation &amp; Technology (who knew Apple Valley even had such a department?), $67K more for Code Enforcement, $65K more for Planning &amp; Community Development, $36K more for the Animal Shelter, $29K more for the Golf Course, $13K more for VVEDA Retirement (after a 1,700% increase this year), $12K more for Economic Development, $10K more for Community Development Block Grant, and $10K more for General Government. And these come after a $5,785,935 bump this year just for Contract and Professional Services.
						</p>
						<p>
							Adding up just these increases, you get almost $3 million in new spending, leaving only half of the proposed tax increase for actual improvements.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you are wondering what the heck happened to the 2018 Town Manager&rsquo;s program to cut costs by ten percent across the board, you&rsquo;re not alone.
						</p>
						<p>
							And what about the Great Leap Forward in prosperity the town was supposed to receive from helping finance the new Big Lots distribution center? Good question.
						</p>
						<p>
							The smart money says <q>No on Measure Owe.</q>
