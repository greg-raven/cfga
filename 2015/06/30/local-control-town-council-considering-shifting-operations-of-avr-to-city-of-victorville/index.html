							Apple Valley&rsquo;s Town Government is considering contracting water operations out to an outside contractor, or even to the City of Victorville.
						</p>
						<p>
							That fact was revealed at the Town of Apple Valley&rsquo;s first Environmental Impact Report (scoping meeting), included in the original <a href="../../../../_assets/img/2015/07/TAV-Initial-Study-AVRWC-Takeover2.pdf">EIR Initial Study</a>&#8216;s telling words:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								<q>There are several options for management of the system, including, but not limited to, management by the Town itself, management by a private contractor hired by the Town, or management by a qualified public agency.</q>
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							At the July 7<sup>th</sup> scoping meeting, the <q>qualified public agency</q> was determined to be none other than the City of Victorville.

							So much for local control.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Apple Valley Ranchos has always, and will continue, to operate with LOCAL management and LOCAL employees.</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span id="more-105"></span>Next Tuesday night, the Town of Apple Valley will be doing a <q>do-over</q> on their Environmental Impact Report (EIR) public scoping meeting. When the meeting was held on July 7th, the Town realized they had stepped in it based on the following:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Poor public notification, including not being listed on the Town&rsquo;s website, and an agenda only being posted a day before the hearing.</li>
							<li>Poor management of the meeting, given the fact nearly 25 people attended the meeting, but very little information was actually given out.</li>
							<li><strong>The revelation that the Town was considering farming out operation of Apple Valley Ranchos Water to the City of Victorville.</strong></li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The Town has now released a new Initial Study on the scope of the EIR, and removed the above wording related to AV Ranchos management.
						</p>

								When it slipped that the City of Victorville may operate the system &#8230; the Town quickly moved to cover things up.

						</div>
						<p>
							That&rsquo;s the end of the issue, right? No more shipping jobs to Victorville?
						</p>
						<p>
							Wrong.
						</p>
						<p>
							They have taken out the direct wording about private contractors or public agencies, but the initial study now says this:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								<q>In addition to the Town&rsquo;s acquisition of the AVR System, the proposed Project includes the Town&rsquo;s subsequent operation of the AVR System, <b><em>although alternatives to the Town&rsquo;s direct operation of the system would be evaluated in the EIR.</em></b></q>
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<h2>
							The Town Council should immediately rule out, via vote of the Town Council, sending operations outside of the Town of Apple Valley, either through a private contractor or the City of Victorville.
