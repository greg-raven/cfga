							APPLE VALLEY &mdash; A new analysis of the town&rsquo;s ongoing water-system acquisition effort shows that water rates could be significantly higher under municipal ownership, a conclusion that contradicts assertions made by public officials.

						<p>
							Conducted by economist John Husing, the analysis focuses on <a href="https://www.waterwedoing.website/docs/toav/2017/20170309-TOAV-measure-f.php">Measure F</a>, which Apple Valley residents will vote on in a June 6 special election. Utilizing data from previously published research, Husing analyzed the potential impact incurring 30 years of revenue-bond debt might have on the town and its residents.
						</p>
						<p>
							According to the analysis, which looked at multiple possible cost scenarios, a $150 million bond paid back over 30 years at a maximum 12 percent interest rate &mdash; figures associated with Measure F &mdash; would result in much higher rates for customers.
						</p>
						<p>
							<q>This bond&rsquo;s annual payments would be $9.2 million at 4.5 (percent) to $18.6 million at 12.0 (percent),</q> the analysis shows. <q>More likely payments would range from $10 million at 5.25 (percent) to $12.4 million at 7.25 (percent) as (interest) rates rise over the next two or three years during which any condemnation proceeding would be occurring.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							Husing concludes the average increase in cost to customers would be <q>$502 or $620 per year equal to $84 or $103 per bi-monthly bill.</q> Additionally, for <q>the 92 (percent) of customers whose average bi-monthly bill is $129 &hellip; this would increase their average bi-monthly water bill to $212 or $232.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							That amounts to increases of 65.1 or 80.4 percent, according to the analysis, which said the <q>full average water cost increase per customer for 30 years at those rates would be $15,056 to $18,589.</q>
