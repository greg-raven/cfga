							APPLE VALLEY &mdash; The victim of a July crash on Interstate 15 that was first reported by the Daily Press and resulted in a felony hit-and-run charge against Apple Valley&rsquo;s finance director is seeking millions in damages from the town, according to a claim filed by her attorney.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span id="more-706"></span>Filed on behalf of Lola Espinoza by the Newport Beach-based law firm Bergener Mirejovsky, the claim seeks $2 million in damages, an amount <q>calculated based on current and future medical treatment and property damage.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							<q>At this time, the investigation is ongoing, and not all City employees, representatives, agents, and agencies are known,</q> the claim states. <q>However, it is believed Marc Puckett was in the course and scope of employment with the City at the time of the incident.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							During the July 20 incident, Espinoza, of Rancho Cucamonga, was driving southbound on I-15 at approximately 60 miles per hour (mph) when her 2011 gray Toyota Prius was hit from behind by a 2011 black Cadillac CTS registered to Puckett.
						</p>
						<p>
							Just before impact, the Cadillac was traveling <q>at a speed greater than 60 mph,</q> according to a California Highway Patrol (CHP) report prepared on Aug. 2, 13 days after the crash and before investigators with CHP&rsquo;s Rancho Cucamonga office identified Puckett as the driver.
						</p>
						<p>
							The claim contends Espinoza was <q>negligently rear-ended by City employee Marc Puckett.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							The Town Clerk&rsquo;s Office received the claim on Nov. 20, two weeks before the San Bernardino County District Attorney filed a felony charge against Puckett. It was obtained by the Daily Press late Wednesday via a California Public Records Act request.
						</p>
						<p>
							Espinoza&rsquo;s attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. Town officials, meanwhile, have repeatedly emphasized the <q>alleged incident occurred outside of employment with the Town.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							The Town Council rejected the claim by a 4-0 vote Tuesday &mdash; Councilor Barb Stanton was absent &mdash; a move that fell in line with staff&rsquo;s recommendation, town documents show. A civil lawsuit is likely to follow, but court records showed no such filing as of Thursday.
						</p>
						<p>
							Town spokesperson Gina Whiteside said the Council&rsquo;s rejection was <q>consistent with past actions regarding rejected claims.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							<q>The Town will not provide additional comments on this matter, which could involve potential litigation,</q> Whiteside said via email Thursday.
						</p>
						<p>
							[&hellip;]
						</p>
						<p>
							Meanwhile, Espinoza was taken to Kaiser Permanente in Ontario for treatment after she complained of injuries to her neck and back, among others.
						</p>
						<p>
							Espinoza previously told the Daily Press she has not been able to receive cortisone shots for pain in her back because Puckett&rsquo;s insurance doesn&rsquo;t cover the costs, adding that she pays out of pocket for massages in lieu of the medical treatment.
						</p>
						<p>
							Puckett, meanwhile, has denied all requests for comment since August. He has been on paid administrative leave from his Town Hall position since Dec. 7, according to a previous Daily Press report.
