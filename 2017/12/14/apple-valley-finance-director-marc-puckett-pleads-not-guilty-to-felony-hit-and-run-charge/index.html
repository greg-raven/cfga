							RANCHO CUCAMONGA &mdash; Marc Puckett, the Apple Valley finance director who has been on paid administrative leave from his Town Hall position since Dec. 7, has pleaded not guilty to a felony charge filed against him earlier this month, San Bernardino County court records show.
						</p>
						<p>
							Puckett, 55, of Aliso Viejo, faces felony hit-and-run in connection with a July 20 crash on southbound Interstate 15 that allegedly resulted in him fleeing the scene. He entered a Rancho Cucamonga courtroom on Thursday and pleaded not guilty, nine days after the charge was filed.
						</p>
						<p>
							A check of court records on Wednesday revealed Puckett&rsquo;s arraignment had not yet been scheduled. It&rsquo;s likely he requested a hearing after entering the courtroom considering the arraignment was not on Thursday&rsquo;s court calendar, according to San Bernardino County District Attorney spokesperson Chris Lee.
						</p>
						<p>
							[&hellip;]
						</p>
						<p>
							The not guilty plea comes two days after the Apple Valley Town Council rejected a claim &mdash; filed by the Newport Beach-based Bergener Mirejovsky law firm on behalf of Espinoza &mdash; that sought $2 million in damages and argued that Puckett was <q>in the course and scope of employment</q> with the town at the time of the incident.
						</p>
						<p>
							A civil lawsuit will likely be filed as a result.
						</p>
						<p>
							Puckett remains out of custody, according to jail records. He is due back in court Dec. 28 for a pre-preliminary hearing that was also set for a bail review, court records show.
