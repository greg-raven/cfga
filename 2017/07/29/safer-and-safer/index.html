							In 1988 when the Town of Apple Valley incorporated, the population was 41,387 and there were six policemen. By 2013, the population had increased 67% to 69,135, but the police department had increased 750% to 51.
						</p>
						<span id="more-661"></span> 
						<p>
							Now we learn that the town&rsquo;s public safety contract has increased by $4.1 million over an eight-year period, that costs are projected to increase by $1.2 million over the next two years, there are additional costs on the horizon, and that our current annual increases of $500,000 or more are currently <q>not sustainable,</q> even with more growth (<q>Apple Valley adopts &lsquo;flat&rsquo; budget,</q> Daily Press, July 11, 2017).
						</p>
						<p>
							This is difficult to reconcile with the Town&rsquo;s motto: <q>A better way of life.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							Maybe the answer is linked to the signs at the Town borders, which read, <q>We are building an inclusive community.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							For those unfamiliar with liberal hate speech, what this means is that if you &mdash; like the founders of Apple Valley &mdash; love the desert, are an upstanding citizen, and support yourself, you aren&rsquo;t wanted by those in Town Hall.
						</p>
						<p>
							Why? Law-abiding, self-sufficient citizens don&rsquo;t need more or bigger government, so they must be replaced with those who either rely on or need the control of the government.
						</p>
						<p>
							And that is just where we find ourselves today, not only nationally but right here in Apple Valley. Maybe it is not a coincidence that the area around Town Hall has the nickname <q>Felony Flats.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							Congratulations, Town Hall. Great job.
