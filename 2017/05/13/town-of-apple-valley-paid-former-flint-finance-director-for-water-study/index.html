							The Town of Apple Valley paid the Former Finance Director for the City of Flint hundreds of thousands of dollars for an <q>independent</q> financial analysis of Measure F, the $150 million bond associated with their attempted eminent domain takeover of their private water company.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span id="more-628"></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>In 2016, former Flint, MI Finance Director Marc Puckett agreed to be <a href="http://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/2015/apple-valley/marc-puckett/">paid $322,217 for the fiscal year ending in July 2017</a>!</strong> This is someone who Flint City Councilman Scott Kinkaid once said <a href="https://waterwedoing.website/docs/1999/19990326-FJ-puckett-vacation.php"><q>should have been terminated.</q></a>
						</p>
						<p>
							The previous year (2016), Puckett was paid $314,109 by the Town of Apple Valley. Former Flint Journal Columnist Andrew Heller once referred to Puckett as <a href="https://www.waterwedoing.website/docs/2001/20010815-FJ-city-chaos.php"><q>the former finance director who resigned after costing the city a million dollars for screwing up the pension funds.</q></a>
						</p>
						<p>
							Puckett, current Apple Valley Finance Director and former Flint Finance Director, in his <q>independent</q> report is obscuring the fact that the funds for Apple Valley Water infrastructure improvements come from $4.2 million in net revenues, plus an additional $2 million a year from Liberty Utilities. Puckett&rsquo;s plan would eliminate funds for water infrastructure improvements, and open up Apple Valley ratepayers to <a href="https://www.waterwedoing.website/docs/2017/04/20170412-av-water-measure-Husing.php">at least $500 &mdash; each year &mdash; in higher water fees to pay for a $150 million debt.</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							Puckett&rsquo;s analysis is the sole analysis being used in taxpayer-funded videos, as well as soon to come taxpayer-funded mailers.
						</p>
						<p>
							The one and only financial expert to weigh in for the Town of Apple Valley on the financial cost of the $150 million dollar bond &mdash; Marc Puckett &mdash; <a href="https://waterwedoing.website/docs/1999/19990224-FJ-pension-fund.php">once cost the City of Flint&rsquo;s taxpayers over $1 million before resigning in disgrace</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="https://waterwedoing.website/docs/1999/19990909-FJ-shortfalls.php">An outside auditor was brought into Flint following his resignation and found the following</a>:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>From 1996 to Puckett&rsquo;s exit, the City incorrectly misdirected some $6 million in property tax payments.</li>
							<li>From 1996 to Puckett&rsquo;s exit, Puckett as Finance Director failed to pay millions in industry facility and commercial facility taxes to the State Government.</li>
							<li>The city violated state law by spending beyond the budget adopted by the City Council in certain areas.</li>
							<li>A lack of employees in the City Finance and Budget department resulted in transactions not being recorded on the city&rsquo;s general ledger in a timely way, making it impossible to compare the city budget to its actual spending on a monthly or quarterly basis.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							Again, this is the person that the Town of Apple Valley has paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in the past year &mdash; and the sole financial expert for the Town regarding Measure F.
						</p>
						<p>
							Puckett&rsquo;s mishandling of the City of Flint&rsquo;s Finance Department had ramifications for years to follow for the people of Flint. Soon after Puckett&rsquo;s resignation, the Mayor who hired Puckett was recalled due to the disastrous financial state the City was in. A year after that, the State of Michigan installed an Emergency Manager to handle Flint&rsquo;s finances. It was the state&rsquo;s Emergency Manager who recommended switching to the Flint River as a water source. That decision led to the <a href="https://www.google.com/#q=%23flintwatercrisis">#FlintWaterCrisis</a>.
