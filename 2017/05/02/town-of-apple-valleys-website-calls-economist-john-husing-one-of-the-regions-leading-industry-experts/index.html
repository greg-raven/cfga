							4 out of 10 market reports endorsed by the Town were written by or contributed to by John Husing
						</p>
						<p>
							As Town staff and the Yes on Measure F campaign are faced with the brutal reality of their financial numbers &mdash; showing the Town would have to charge a $500 to $600 or more fee each year to pay the interest on debt &mdash; they are also distancing themselves of their very close history with economist John Husing.
						</p>
						<p>
							As part of the Town&rsquo;s efforts to attract commercial businesses, it provides market reports on its website to promote the positive benefits of running a business in Apple Valley. Four of the 10 market reports endorsed by the Town were written by or contributed to by Dr. John Husing, Ph.D.

							<a href="https://www.waterwedoing.website/docs/2017/04/20170412-av-water-measure-Husing.php">In a report provided to the <i>Daily Press</i> directly by Dr. Husing</a>, he analyzed Measure F and concluded that with a $150 million bond, ratepayers would have to be charged between $500 and $600 or more each year to pay for the bond &mdash; none of it going to clean, safe drinking water.
