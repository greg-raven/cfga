							California&rsquo;s high desert in San Bernardino County is a great part of the Golden State. The region has consistently elected strong conservative voices to represent citizens, and the people have long stood for lower taxes and smaller government. But a big lie is going around the Town of Apple Valley that should put everyone on alert. If it can happen there, it could happen anywhere in California.
						</p>
						<p>
							Do you support Prop 13?
						</p>
						<p>
							Do you oppose higher gas taxes and vehicle license fees?
						</p>
						<p>
							If you&rsquo;re like me then the answers to those questions are simple. What do they have to do with Apple Valley and a $150 million water bond?
						</p>
						<p>
							Plenty &hellip; read on to learn why.
						</p>
						<p>
							Local politicians in the Town of Apple Valley have lost sight of conservative values and are in the midst of trying to convince voters to pass Measure F, a $150 million bond to be repaid plus interest, by adding a new fee onto peoples&rsquo; existing water bill. The government is arguing that you can borrow $150 million in bond debt for the purpose of using eminent domain to take over a water system, and claiming that it won&rsquo;t cost taxpayers anything to repay the debt and maintain quality water service.
						</p>
						<p>
							Does that even remotely seem believable? It isn&rsquo;t, but that&rsquo;s not stopping unelected bureaucrats from trying to pull a fast one on voters late in the election.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Town&rsquo;s soon-to-be-retiring Town Manager used his <q>discretion</q> to use tax dollars to pay $25,000 for economist Christopher Thornberg to opine that the Town&rsquo;s plan was smart and that voters have nothing to worry about. It&rsquo;s pretty sad when government uses tax dollars to try and convince voters to go into debt. Technically, that&rsquo;s illegal, and I&rsquo;m sure that the Fair Political Practices Commission will be interested to learn more about this.
						</p>
						<p>
							When people consider whether or not to trust Dr. Thornberg&rsquo;s position, here are two points of reference to consider:
						</p>
						<p>
							1) Dr. Thornberg opposes Prop 13&rsquo;s homeowner property tax protections. The California Taxpayers Association reported, <q>The most vocal opposition to Proposition 13 came from Christopher Thornberg, founding principal of Beacon Economics, who called the proposition <q>evil,</q> and said: <q>I can&rsquo;t think of one reason in the world why Prop 13 should exist.</q></q>
						</p>
						<p>
							2) Dr. Thornberg was a strong supporter of recent increases to California&rsquo;s gas tax and increases to vehicle license fees. Here&rsquo;s what he wrote in the Inland Valley Daily Bulletin: <q>After a heated battle to raise taxes and pay for much-needed road repairs and improvements, Senate Bill 1 is awaiting signature by Gov. Jerry Brown. But the fight for California&rsquo;s transportation future isn&rsquo;t over yet &hellip; SB1 is an important first step in closing that gap. But it won&rsquo;t be enough.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							Do you believe Prop 13 should be repealed?
						</p>
						<p>
							Do you believe we need to raise gas taxes and vehicle license fees?
						</p>
						<p>
							Christopher Thornberg does.
						</p>
						<p>
							He also wants you to believe you can borrow hundreds of millions of dollars and somehow it won&rsquo;t cost you a penny. We&rsquo;ve heard that before on many different occasions, in particular, California&rsquo;s High-Speed Rail boondoggle.
						</p>
						<p>
							Dr. Thornberg doesn&rsquo;t seem to be too worried about Apple Valley taxpayers. He collected $25,000 to promote a ballot measure that two economists, Dr. John Husing (The Inland Empire&rsquo;s most respected economist) and Dr. Rodney Smith, have separately concluded will increase water bills by $500 on every resident to repay $150 million in debt.
						</p>
						<p>
							It&rsquo;s disappointing when bureaucrats think voters aren&rsquo;t smart enough to see through smoke and mirrors. But in Apple Valley, I know that voters are very well informed, and they recognize that borrowing $150 million and having to repay the debt, plus interest, will have expensive consequences now and for generations to come.
						</p>
						<p>
							I don&rsquo;t believe Apple Valley Voters will fall for Measure F&rsquo;s <q>Big Lie.</q> They&rsquo;ll stay true to the region&rsquo;s conservative values by voting NO on June 6th.
						</p>
						<p>
