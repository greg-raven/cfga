							What the Town (and Yes On F campaign) leaves out of the news of Liberty&rsquo;s 2016 Financial Report:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Liberty made $3.2 million in capital improvements, despite the Town&rsquo;s efforts to block system improvements. Schedule A-1, pdf page 19 shows $3.678 million in capital improvements &mdash; approximately $400,000 was contributed by outside sources (developers). Liberty is on pace to invest $6.5 million in 2017.</li>
							<li>The report shows not a single ratepayer dollar was spent on condemnation or political activities &mdash; pdf page 10 Income statement adjusted to exclude non-regulated activity. (note &mdash; schedule C-5 discloses all NON-ratepayer 2016 expenses for Measure V/W at $560,793).</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							NOW in addition to the more than $4.2 million missing from the Town&rsquo;s numbers for net income, the Town&rsquo;s press release lists a number of shortfalls in other calculations:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Liberty collected $661,724 less from customers for water service in 2016, compared to 2015) pdf page 41 &mdash; schedule B-1, line 30. Oops, that&rsquo;s $661,724 less for Measure F debt.</li>
							<li>Administrative and general salaries were reduced by $57,371 (line 22) &mdash; $57,371 less</li>
							<li>Liberty cut operating costs significantly. According to pdf page 44 &mdash; schedule B-2, line 42, operating expenses have decreased by more than $1.6 million. Within that $831,101 was reduced in administrative and general expenses (line 36).Â Oops &mdash; that&rsquo;s $1.6 million gone for debt service</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							GRAND TOTAL MISSING FROM MARC PUCKETT&rsquo;S CALCULATIONS (AT LEAST): <strong>$6,519,095</strong>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Yikes! Where is tax-increase loving Dr. Christopher Thornberg when you need him!
