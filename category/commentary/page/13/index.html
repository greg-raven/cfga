						</p>
						<p>
							That fact was revealed at the Town of Apple Valley&rsquo;s first Environmental Impact Report (scoping meeting), included in the original <a href="../../../../_assets/img/2015/07/TAV-Initial-Study-AVRWC-Takeover2.pdf">EIR Initial Study</a>&#8216;s telling words:
						</p>
						<blockquote>

								<q>There are several options for management of the system, including, but not limited to, management by the Town itself, management by a private contractor hired by the Town, or management by a qualified public agency.</q>
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							At the July 7<sup>th</sup> scoping meeting, the <q>qualified public agency</q> was determined to be none other than the City of Victorville.

							After reviewing the voluminous 284-page draft budget document from the Town, I regret to inform you all that there is <strong>not one dollar</strong> or expenditure line item specifically identified to fund the Council-directed Ranchos Water Company takeover effort.
						</p>
						<p>
							Despite the hundreds of thousands of dollars already spent, with much more to come, as well as Mayor Pro Tem Barb Stanton stating at the last Council meeting that there needs to be transparency in funding related to the takeover process, there is not a word in the narrative or dollar amount in the line items to inform the public how their tax dollars are being squandered on this <strong>unnecessary</strong> eminent domain effort.
						</p>
						<p>
							Since we know directly from the Town Council that the eminent domain process is moving forward, and the <q>H2<em>Ouch</em></q> misinformation campaign is still in full swing, tax dollars will continue to be spent on this effort. Where is the money for this effort coming from in the proposed budget? Is it being purposefully hidden in other funds, despite the public&rsquo;s call for disclosure of these expenditures? I&rsquo;ll ask at the next Council meeting on June 9th &mdash; hope to see you all there!

							I read Mr. David Christman&rsquo;s letter that tier pricing of water is in jeopardy. He apparently is referring to an appellate court ruling for a case originating in San Juan Capistrano. He is mistaken that it was tier rates only that were involved, however. The primary issue was a publicly controlled water company set tier rates without establishing the cost of service to justify the rate increases.

						</p>
						<p>
							As are resident of the Town of Apple Valley, can you believe this? If this isn&rsquo;t the most cynical thing I&rsquo;ve read in a long time, I don&rsquo;t know what is. For months, the whole premise of the TOAV&rsquo;s hostile take-over of AVRWC was that the elimination of all that horrible profit would allow the TOAV to lower prices. Now, TOAV is acknowledging that they will not be lowering rates. The TOAV won&rsquo;t even promise to keep rates stable, only that they&rsquo;ll try. Yeah, right &hellip;

							Apple Valley, CA &mdash; One of the Town of Apple Valley&rsquo;s recent H2Ours pretexts for the hostile government seizure of Apple Valley Ranchos Water Company (AVRWC) is that under Town control of the water, <q>the people have a greater say in setting water rates.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							The Town Government has even disingenuously stated <q>the citizens would have the right to vote on increases in water rates.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							This is refuted both by Apple Valley&rsquo;s own past history, and the very structure of Proposition 218.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>What is Proposition 218?</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							According to CaliforniaTaxData.com: <q>In November 1996, California voters passed Proposition 218, the <q>Right to Vote on Taxes Act.</q> This constitutional amendment protects taxpayers by limiting the methods by which local governments can create or increase taxes, fees, and charges without taxpayer consent. Proposition 218 requires voter approval prior to imposition or increase of general taxes, assessments, and certain user fees.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>The citizens&rsquo; right to &lsquo;vote on increases in water rates&rsquo;</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							The Town&rsquo;s assertion that <q>the citizens would have the right to vote on increases in water rates</q> implies that this would happen automatically. It doesn&rsquo;t, and revisiting the Town&rsquo;s 75 percent increases in sewer rates since 2008 proves that. (Sewer rates fall under the same Proposition 218 restrictions.)
						</p>
						<p>
							During the last sewer rate increase imposed by the Apple Valley Town Council, the body spent 20 minutes discussing it. There was no public vote on whether or not to increase the sewer rates.
						</p>
						<p>
							The increase before that? Four minutes &hellip;

							Apple Valley, CA &mdash; President Reagan famously said, <q>The nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I&rsquo;m from the government, and I&rsquo;m here to help.</q> These words only ring more true as time progresses as we watch our already bloated government take on even more responsibility to <q>help</q> us in our lives.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the national front we have Obamacare. This behemoth of legislation promised to <q>help</q> Americans, because, surely the government can make better choices then you and your doctor can.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the local side we are seeing a very familiar government issue, using the same talking points. Apple Valley&rsquo;s Town Government wants to take over a private business because it thinks the rates are too high. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it&rsquo;s a well run business, nor whether it delivers a product directly to you instead of going through a government bureaucracy first. Where they&rsquo;ll take their cut. It&rsquo;s a private company and they&rsquo;ll be damned if a private will charge for a product.
						</p>
						<p>
							In line with both takeovers, here are three lies we&rsquo;ve heard before with Obamacare and are hearing again from Apple Valley&rsquo;s Town Government and H<sub>2</sub>Ours.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Lie #1 &mdash; It lowers your cost</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Obamacare &mdash; The peddlers of Obamacare claimed it would cut the cost of your health care. If only! When Obamacare went into effect, it created higher premiums and increased healthcare costs.
						</p>

							H<sub>2</sub>Ours &mdash; Town ownership will provide water rate stability? Historically, when cities have taken over private water companies using eminent domain, the cost to run them have stayed the same or increased. And honestly, when has government EVER done anything more efficiently than private companies?
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Lie #2 &mdash; It will not cost taxpayers</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Obamacare &mdash; We were told that Obamacare would not increase the deficit. As it turns out, the costs of taking over an industry were not paid by money that magically appeared. Instead, Obamacare will increase cost to the taxpayer.
						</p>
						<p>
							H<sub>2</sub>Ours &mdash; The long-term deficits that the Apple Valley town government currently carries will only increase if they borrow money (on top of the money already spent to create a sham of justification for the takeover) to cover the cost of the takeover.
						</p>
						<p>
							Further, they proudly claim <q>The Town of Apple Valley would be eligible for advantageous government funding not available to a private company.</q> First, this statement is untrue. Second, they admit that they can&rsquo;t afford to run it by themselves! These funding streams are funneled through the government but ultimately originate from our wallets as taxes. With the amount of government debt already owed, is it wise to borrow more to takeover a private company?
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>Lie #3 &mdash; If you like your provider, you can keep your provider</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Obamacare &mdash; It hurts me to even mention this one. One of the biggest and most blatant lies ever told to the American people.
						</p>
						<p>
							H<sub>2</sub>Ours &mdash; What makes a company? Is it the service they provide &hellip; or the employees and managers who provide it? Although the new owners, Liberty Utilities has guaranteed to retain 100% of the employees at AV Ranchos, the Town has NOT done the same. Apple Valley Ranchos is known for the high quality service, so why wouldn&rsquo;t the Town make the same commitment?
						</p>
						<p>
							What&rsquo;s likely to happen is that the same high quality service you expect will no longer exist &hellip; because those same people will either leave or be let go.
						</p>
						<p>
							Obamacare and H<sub>2</sub>Ours &hellip; two peas in a government takeover pod.
