							FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
						</p>
						<p>
							November 2, 2016 &mdash; Apple Valley, CA &mdash; Bryen Wright, candidate for Apple Valley Town Council, release the following statement on the questionable connections between the Town of Apple Valley and recent donations by Burrtec Industries:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								At the Apple Valley Town Council Meeting of October 25th, 2016, the Town of Apple Valley voted to enter into a 50-year lease with Burrtec Industries on Burrtec&rsquo;s property adjacent to the Victor Valley Materials Recovery Facility (MRF). In the 30 days leading up to that vote, two contributions totaling $10,000 were made to the Town sponsored pro-Measure W campaign committee. This $10,000 contribution surpassed all other previous contributions combined at that point.
							</p>
							<p>
								The timing and impact of these contributions are highly suspect, and suggest a Town Council whose decisions can be purchased for the right price.
							</p>
							<p>
								I strongly encourage the Measure W committee to immediately return these contributions, and for there to be an investigation into the Town&rsquo;s dealings with Burrtec in the weeks leading up to this Council vote. I will be personally writing to the San Bernardino County Public Integrity Unit to investigate this matter.
							</p>
							<p>
								We must stand vigilant against corruption, as even the faintest hint of corruption can cause harm to our great Town.
							</p>
