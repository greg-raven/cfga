						<p>
							First we learned that the <a href="https://www.vvdailypress.com">Town had spent <strong>$50,000</strong> to an anti-gun, hot shot Democratic law firm in Sacramento.</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							<a href="https://www.vvdailypress.com"><strong>In a just published article by the Daily Press</strong></a>, it is pointed out that they included bogus information about Measure W and Measure V in the Town&rsquo;s newsletter.
						</p>
						<pre>Estimated Price: <strong>$12,000</strong></pre>
						<p>
							Recently, an article in <a href="http://www.flashreport.org/blog/2016/10/18/will-apple-valley-become-californias-flint-mi/">The Flash Report blog stated that:</a>
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								The newsletter is neither impartial nor merely informational as the law demands.
							</p>
							<p>
								When shenanigans like this take place, public trust in elected officials wanes.
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							The Town&rsquo;s newsletter with the false <q>analysis</q> of Measure V and W was questionable enough, but just this past week, residents were greeted by a clear campaign mailer that distorted the issue in Measure W&rsquo;s favor.
						</p>
						<p>
							The mailer falsely paints the picture the Measure W&rsquo;s change in the law is directly related to the water system, when the actually text of Measure W says that it is about anything <strong>except the water system.</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Actual language of Measure W states:
						</p>
						<blockquote>
							<p>
								No ordinance or resolution authorizing the issuance of bonds or other forms of public debt in an amount exceeding <strong><em><u>five million dollars ($5,000,000) </u></em></strong>to provide funds for the acquisition, construction, improvement, or financing of an enterprise, secured by revenues derived from the operation of the enterprise, shall become effective unless approved by the voters, <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong><em><u>except</u></em></strong> </span>as provided herein.
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>
							It then lists the four requirements that are already required by law or done by the Town of Apple Valley.  Measure W actually excludes action on the water system.
						</p>
						<pre>Mailer price to every household: <strong>$20,000.</strong></pre>
						<p>
							<strong>Estimated total so far: $82,000 of taxpayer funds spent on political campaigning.</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Now, the Town is set to vote on Tuesday night to Support Measure W and Oppose Measure V, authorizing spending tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars on political campaign mailers and other resources to benefit the very politicians that are up for re-election.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>WE MUST STOP THIS!</strong>
						</p>
						<p>
							Write the Town Clerk so that she can forward your concerns to the Town Council: <a href="mailto:townclerk@applevalley.org">townclerk@applevalley.org</a>
						</p>
						<p>
							You can also make your voice known by attending the Town Council meeting on the night of Tuesday, October 26<sup>th</sup>, and tell them NOT to spend one more dime on political campaign materials!
