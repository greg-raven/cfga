							After over 3,800 registered voters signed a petition to allow for a direct vote on the cost of eminent domain of Liberty Utilities, the Apple Valley just trolled its entire citizenry by placing a counter-measure on the ballot last night &mdash; one that effectively places so many restrictions on a public vote trigger, <i>it effectively would never happen.</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							<span id="more-427"></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							It&rsquo;s cynical trolling from public officials at its very worst.
						</p>
						<p>
							<img class="aligncenter wp-image-429 size-full" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/av-trolls.jpg" alt="av-trolls" width="600" height="400" srcset="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/av-trolls.jpg 600w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/av-trolls-300x200.jpg 300w, ../../../../wp-content/uploads/2016/07/av-trolls-450x300.jpg 450w" />

							Instead of allowing a public vote on public debt over $10 million (which the citizen-signed petition allowed), the Town decided to lower it to a threshold of $5 million. But a vote would never be triggered if the following happen instead:
						</p>
						<ul>
							<li>The Town Council provides a public hearing prior to issuing the debt.</li>
							<li>The Council certifies (based on financial analysis) that the projected revenues from the enterprise exceed the debt payments proposed;</li>
							<li>The Council certifies that debt will not be paid by the taxing power of the Town; and</li>
							<li>The Council requires an annual independent audit to ensure that the proceeds of the debt are utilized in connection with the enterprise only.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
							The Town Council effectively trolled its citizens by saying <q>you can trust us, because we never lie and we&rsquo;re always right.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							Here&rsquo;s why each of these <q>public vote killer</q> items is ridiculous based on the law, and the past experience of this government body and others:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li><b>Required Public Hearing.</b> Any bond issuance of this amount needs to have a publicly-accessibly hearing anyway. Revolutionary! The public hearing requirement does nothing to offer up a voter check and balance. It just strengthens a rubber-stamping Council like the current one.</li>
							<li><b>Bond revenues exceed bond repayment &mdash; based on what Council says.</b> This is already the law under Proposition 218. You can&rsquo;t issue a revenue bond unless this is certified.<br />
							Yet, how many times has a Council in the High Desert promised that issuing revenue bonds would be covered by the revenues brought in? Does Victor Valley Water Replenishment District revenue bond wrangling ring a bell? One of the Council members in a neighboring city <a href="http://www.vvdailypress.com/article/20160411/NEWS/160419955">said that their revenue bond debt is a <q>financial risk</q></a> that threatens their city. Or the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-beaumont-corruption-20160517-snap-story.html">seven Beaumont, CA, officials indicted for public corruption</a> for the sale of municipal bonds handled by companies in which they had a public interest? <q>Trust us</q> indeed!</li>
							<li><b>Certification that no taxes will be used to pay debt.</b> Another <q>trust us</q> provision, and also &mdash; already law. Bond law already prohibits access to tax revenue for repayment of bonds.</li>
							<li><b>Requiring annual independent audit.</b> The City of Bell, famous for public corruption, had an independent auditor (they also had the same legal firm as City Attorney as the Town of Apple Valley). Again, another <q>trust us</q> provision that does nothing to give the voters a voice on debt.</li>
						</ol>
						<p>
							The Town&rsquo;s ballot measure is intended to do one thing &mdash; confuse voters in the hopes that they won&rsquo;t require the Town to put any sort of financing plan on the ballot.
						</p>
						<p>
							As former Flint, Michigan Finance Director Marc Puckett said of the Town offering a financing plan of the water acquisition &mdash; <a href="http://www.vvdailypress.com/article/20160629/NEWS/160629668/0/SEARCH">it would only come after a court ruling</a>.
						</p>
						<p>
							The Town&rsquo;s measure might as well be called the <q>Rubber Stamp Our Decisions</q> Act.
