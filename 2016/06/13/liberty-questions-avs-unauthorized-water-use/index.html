							APPLE VALLEY &mdash; Liberty Utilities is questioning the town&rsquo;s ability to safely manage a water system after members of town staff were involved in the unauthorized use of the company&rsquo;s water on the Apple Valley Golf Course.<span id="more-373"></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							An investigation conducted by Liberty after an April 29 incident revealed town staff broke the lock on a vault that houses the company&rsquo;s meter and control valve, Liberty&rsquo;s General Manager Tony Penna told the Daily Press.
						</p>
						<p>
							A letter written by Penna &mdash; obtained by the Daily Press &mdash; showed that town staff activated the service for the golf course without authorization, which resulted in the use of what Liberty&rsquo;s Superintendent of Operations Carol Thomas-Keefer later calculated as approximately 869,000 gallons of water between April 29 and May 2.
						</p>
						<p>
							The town incurred a bill amounting to $6,754.61 as a result of the unauthorized use, according to Thomas-Keefer.
						</p>
						<p>
							<q>In a typical situation where water is stolen or taken without our knowledge or authorization,</q> Penna wrote to Town Manager Frank Robinson, <q>we traditionally address such actions by making a formal criminal report to the authorities.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							Penna spoke to <q>illegal</q> action in the letter, but told the Daily Press authorities weren&rsquo;t involved because he wants to improve the company&rsquo;s relationship with the town, which is <q>dysfunctional</q> in his opinion, adding that concern over public safety is the real issue.
						</p>
						<p>
							<q>You have the opportunity when you have two different systems that they get cross-connected, and water flows in two directions,</q> Penna said. <q>So what were to happen if water came from their system (into ours)? We didn&rsquo;t test that water. We didn&rsquo;t disinfect it. I had no idea what the water quality was &hellip; Were public health issues considered, or was there somebody on staff who even recognized the potential for them?</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							Robinson, who was briefed on the April 29 incident by the town&rsquo;s Director of Public Works Greg Snyder, said he apologized to Penna by phone for what he described as a breakdown in communication after a power surge knocked out the pumps to the town&rsquo;s well that services the golf course.
						</p>
						<p>
							Golf course staff notified town staff of the situation, Robinson said, and Snyder was then contacted.
						</p>
						<p>
							<q>His direction to them was to contact Liberty,</q> Robinson said, <q>(to) go to the location where the meter is and where the backflow is, and have Liberty come out there to &hellip; make arrangements to get the water turned back on so that we can water while we get the pump and everything replaced.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							<q>Something happened &mdash; a breakdown in communication between our staff and the golf course staff &mdash; and instead of doing that they did just the opposite. They turned the water back on before &hellip; Liberty was contacted.</q>
						</p>
						<p>
							Robinson added there was never any intent on the town&rsquo;s part to steal water or break into the vault.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thomas-Keever, however, said the incident raises another concern linked to the town&rsquo;s eminent domain action against Liberty for ownership of the water system.
						</p>
						<p>
							<q>It makes me wonder, though, what type of a utility operator they really would be,</q> she said.
						</p>
						<p>
							Robinson declined to comment on the remark, but said procedures have been enacted to ensure an adequate water supply in the event of future pump failure.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thomas-Keefer provided information related to stand-by service that would allow activation in the future, but Robinson declined the service, citing the town&rsquo;s new waterstoring procedures as a sufficient back-up plan.
						</p>
						<p>
							As a result, Penna said Liberty will remove the meter to prevent future unauthorized use.
