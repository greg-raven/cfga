							A better way of life or rotten to the core? Apple Valley has always tried to portray a certain image. They have always spent much time and money on <q>PR</q>. So what is going on here? We went from having millions in reserves and always seemed to be able to pay our bills and provide the services that were needed. Now we are borrowing money to pay for current services. We are a city getting a pay day loan. What type of people use pay day loan services? Most of the time it is someone who is desperate, bad with money and they are in financial trouble. It is safe to say Apple Valley is in financial trouble but how we take care of this problem will determine if the city goes bankrupt.

							How did we get here? Well the current council is the primary cause. Going back many years now the town started down the path of trying to take over Liberty Water. Liberty is only one of a number of private water companies who provides water to parts of Apple Valley. During this process the council had dozens of closed session meetings talking with their BB&amp;K lawyers and staff. Contrary to what the council is currently saying, the council was told many times the true costs involved in this water acquisition. But this isn&rsquo;t anything they disclose to the public. AV is screwed up &mdash; just check out the Presentation to the Town Council on April 25, 2017 by the now disgraced<br />
							Assistant Town Manager Marc Puckett on <q>How the Town will finance the purchase of the water system.</q> Puckett is not disgraced just because of the wreck he was involved in. He is disgraced because of his very poor handling of AV&rsquo;s finances that have put us on the verge of bankruptcy. And yet AV still has his presentation on their web page justifying the acquisition of Liberty.
