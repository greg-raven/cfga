							Over the last few weeks, I have been examining the credit card statements of our Town Council members. And in the upcoming weeks, I am going to share with you some of the things that have caught my eye.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span id="more-732"></span>
						</p>
						<p>
							We spend thousands of dollars per year to send our elected officials on out of town trips. It all adds up.
						</p>
						<p>
							You have membership dues or registration fees. Then you have to reserve the fancy hotels that cost hundreds of dollars per night. Don&rsquo;t forget to book the flights. Oh, and then we have the airport parking and transportation services. And of course, our public servants need to eat, too!
						</p>
						<p>
							There are so many questions. Like, why do all five members of the Council need to go to the same event? Can&rsquo;t someone take notes? Sheesh!
						</p>
						<p>
							And how do we the taxpayers even know if these events provide real value and not just some excuse to get together, drink and party on our dime?
						</p>
						<p>
							Take the League of California Cities for example. According to its website, it is <q>an association of California city officials who work together to enhance their knowledge and skills, exchange information and combine resources so that they may influence policy decisions that affect cities.</q> Each town or city pays dues based on its population size, which is interesting because, as I have mentioned before, our town leaders don&rsquo;t seem to feel the same way about putting cops on the streets. We haven&rsquo;t had an increase in our deputy patrol count for about a decade now. But I digress.
						</p>
						<p>
							Apple Valley pays approximately $20,000 a year to this organization to cover membership dues. Then there are several subject-specific conferences and seminars that it hosts throughout the year, including an annual conference each September. Registration for the annual conference is more than $500 per person. The hotel is more than $600 per person. Flights are $300 each, plus parking, shuttles, cabs and meals.
						</p>
						<p>
							Do Apple Valley taxpayers really need to pay $10,000 to send five elected officials to the same conference? And I haven&rsquo;t looked, but I bet some senior staff are also attending these as well. Stay tuned.
						</p>
