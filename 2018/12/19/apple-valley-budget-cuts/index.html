							Eight months ago the Town of Apple Valley officially acknowledged what concerned citizens had been saying for years: Spending was way out of line (<q>More cuts to hit Town Hall amid budget crunch,</q> Daily Press, April 22, 2018). From sky-high salaries and pensions to wasteful practices to downright unnecessary (and in some cases improper) expenditures, the Town had blown through millions in reserves and was facing a $2.6 million budget shortfall. Everyone was going to have to feel the pinch, we were told.
						</p>
						<span id="more-861"></span> 
						<p>
							We don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s really going on in Town Hall because Town Manager Doug Robertson will not allow a full independent (let alone forensic) audit, even in the wake of the departures of the two top finance officers, and getting financial data out of Town Hall is notoriously difficult.
						</p>
						<p>
							But let&rsquo;s look at some numbers that are available. In 2012, the Town paid law firm BB&amp;K $405,886. By 2014, that amount was up to $710,801. A year later in 2015, $1,439,438. Last year, 2017, that amount was $1,276,852. The year-to-date total for 2018 is already $1,306,394, a $29,542 (2.31%) increase over 2017. That&rsquo;s a 221% increase in under 6 years. There are also attorney payments to Jones &amp; Mayer, Stradling Yocca Carlson and Rauth ($80,000), and Chapman Cutler LLP ($120,000).
						</p>
						<p>
							Charles Abbott Associates, the Town&rsquo;s engineering firm, has already received 167% more in 2018 than in 2012.
						</p>
						<p>
							By comparison, the increase in policing costs (which we were assured will sink the Town&rsquo;s finances) have gone up only 24% since 2012.
						</p>
						<p>
							Perhaps the worst aspect is that Town Hall&rsquo;s spending practices are removing the benefits of living in our rural community while amplifying the disadvantages.
